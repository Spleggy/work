# Python Projects
1. [basic error handling](python/basic_error_handling/main.py): this is a simple maths python application to demonstrate using error handling.
2. [triangles](python/triangles/triangles.py): this python application takes in user input for 3 sides of a triangle and then gives 5 different options of what to do with the information provided.
3. [functions](python/functions): this task shows the use of a functions python file in order to structure the code. This was also my first attempt at a more complex application using Python.
4. [graphing](python/graphing): this task was designed for my Data Science assignment, which used Python in order to create a graph from big data (only a small amount however to not hang the application). This was used to prove points regarding global warming and justify my research into possible causes behind the biggest contributor, China.
